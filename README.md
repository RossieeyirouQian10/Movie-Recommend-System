# Movie-Recommend-System
Personalize a movie recommendation system to predict movies ratings with Movie Lens dataset 


Recommendation systems are widely used today by big companies such as Amazon, Youtube, and Netflix for their Internet products. A good recommendation system significantly increases their business values. In this notebook, we will use an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm with Spark APIs and Spark SQL to predict the ratings for the movies in MovieLens small dataset.

•	Personalize a movie recommendation system with Spark API to predict movies ratings with Movie Lens dataset 

•	Merge small data tables and perform big data online analytical processing with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm in Spark SQL

•	Develop user-item method of collaborative filter to train model in Spark RDD then evaluate first time model with 0.87 root mean square error (RMSE)

•	Tune hyper-parameter with 5-fold Cross-Validation and ParamGridBuilder to find the best model performance and refit model with smaller 0.69 RMSE
